Research one (or more) of the following:

Ada Lovelace
Alan Turing
John von Neumann
Norbert Wiener
Claude Shannon
Grace Hopper
H. Marshall Mcluhan
Donald Knuth
Richard M. Stallman
Larry Wall

Requirements

At least 3 pages (example: biography, trivia, hometown)
At least 1 Google Font
Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
Keep your code clean and DRY
Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine
Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:

Why Joel admires them
Something Joel doesn't already know about them
Optional extras

Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Try embedding media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud, podcasts)
