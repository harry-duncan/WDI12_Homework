# Triangles
# The program should return whether it a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene. The program should also raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

# Extensions:

# Return the area and diameter as well
# Hint

# The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the triangle inequality.
