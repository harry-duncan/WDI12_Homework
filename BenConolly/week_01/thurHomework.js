// JavaScript Bank
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. 
//The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.

// Bank

// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. 
//The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts.
//It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank
// and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional
//functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.

// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of 
//common functionality.

// Accounts

// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit 
//or withdraw from an account to change the balance.

// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- 
//you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.

// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows 
//that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, 
//make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.

// Tips

// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.

// Bonus

// Ensure that the accounts cannot have negative values.
// Write a 'transfer' on the bank that allows you to transfer amounts between two accounts.
// Additional

// Begin exploring the JavaScript Koans. Fork, clone and start trying them.
