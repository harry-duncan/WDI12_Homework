		<h1>The Supervillain</h1>
		<p>As one of the most important figures in computer science, a key player in World War 2, the leader of a top secret decrypting project, and a futurist with exciting ideas for the future, Alan Turing has attracted a large number of portrayals in popular media, including multiple movie appearances. Most portrayals are serious in nature, and his sexuality is a common theme.</p>
		<p>A more light-hearted and fun portrayal is given in the comic <i>Atomic Robo</i>, a comic by Brian Clevinger and Scott Wegener. The comic focuses on a range of 20th century scientists, following its robot protagonist throughout the range. Volume 6, <i>The Gost of Station X</i> addresses Turing and his legacy. The comic occurs in the modern day, and details a conspiracy around the disappearance of the shed in which Turing worked (which vanishes overnight, leaving behind a complex collection of cut wires in the basement.</p>
		<p>The complete comic is available <a href="http://www.atomic-robo.com/atomicrobo/v6ch1-cover">free online</a>.</p>
