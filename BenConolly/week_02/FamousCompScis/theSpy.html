		<h1>The Spy</h1>
		<p>Turing brought his academic ideas, as well as his passion for cryptography, to the enigma project, where a computer was constructed to run solve a code that was too complex for a person to solve in a reasonable time-frame. Using a machine, possibilities could be run through much more quickly than by traditionally human-driven code-cracking, and so access codes that were impossible to crack within the course of a single day, the length of time any one enigma code was valid.</p>
		<p>Turing never served in an official military capacity, however the top-secret projects that he was involved in were instrumental in the outcome of World War Two, while also advancing understanding of what computers were capable of.</p>
		<p>The computers that Alan were working with would not be recognisable as such today, and worked entirely on solving the code problem, requiring rebuilding if it were to compute other things.</p>
