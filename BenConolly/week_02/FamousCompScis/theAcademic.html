		<h1>The Academic</h1>
		<p>Alan Turing was a noted academic, publishing both before and after the war, and teaching at Manchester University. Turing recieved his education between Cambridge and Princeton, and contributed to both. Turing's most important additions to computer science were the concept of a machine being 'turing complete', the user of an early computer in the cracking of the enigma code machine, as well as speculative thoughts on the future possibilities of computers, including predicting artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>The concept of turing completeness is to have a machine that can model other machiens, and so any turing-complete machine can, in theory, perform the same tasks as any other similar machine, as well as any machine it is designed to imitate. The importance of turing completeness has affected the evolution of programming languages, as well as helping develop the understanding of what computers could be used for.</p>

		<p>Turing spent some time documenting what he saw as the possibilities of computers, not limiting his scope to the limitations of the time's computing powers. This led to the idea of an 'artifical intelligence', that would run within a computer, and be able to perform the same kinds of actions as a biological intelligence. The Turing Test was designed as a way to see if the respondant to a question was a computer generating answers, or another biological intelligence, and a computer that could pass a turing test would be signs of 'true' artifical intelligence. Some of these concepts have been put in turing's mouth.</p>
