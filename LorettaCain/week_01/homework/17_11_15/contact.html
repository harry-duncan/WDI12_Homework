<p class="donald">The short answer: You can't contact him.</p>
<p class="donald">You're welcome to send him a letter addressed as following:</p>
<p class="donald1">Prof. Donald E. Knuth
Computer Science Department
Gates Building 4B
Stanford University
Stanford, CA 94305-9045 USA.</p>
<p class="donald">But he'll probably never see it. He sets one day aside every three months to check his mail. And if it's not a message reporting an error in one of his books, his secretary will either recycle it or he'll use it as printing paper.</p>
<h3 class="donald">A rant about email vs e-mail</h3>
<p class="donald">

"Newly coined nonce words of English are often spelled with a hyphen, but the hyphen disappears when the words become widely used. For example, people used to write ``non-zero'' and ``soft-ware'' instead of ``nonzero'' and ``software''; the same trend has occurred for hundreds of other words. Thus it's high time for everybody to stop using the archaic spelling ``e-mail''. Think of how many keystrokes you will save in your lifetime if you stop now! The form ``email'' has been well established in England for several years, so I am amazed to see Americans being overly conservative in this regard. (Of course, ``email'' has been a familiar word in France, Germany, and the Netherlands much longer than in England --- but for an entirely different reason.)"</p>
